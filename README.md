This repository holds the source for this Specification, part of the family of [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos) from the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://amwa.tv)

<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does it do?

- Enables Registration, Discovery, and Connection Management of [JPEG XS](https://jpeg.org/jpegxs/) Endpoints using the AMWA IS-04 and IS-05 NMOS Specifications.

### Why does it matter?

- It helps ensure consistency between implementations offering NMOS control for JPEG XS endpoints.

### How does it work?

- It specifies what resources and attributes MUST be provided when using NMOS with JPEG XS streams.
- It specifies requirements for SDP files.
- It provides examples of how to use IS-04 and IS-05 in the context of JPEG XS streams - specifically JPEG XS encapsulated in RTP as described in IETF [RFC 9134](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9134).
