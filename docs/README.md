<!-- 

Use this file to specify an ordered and leveled markdown list the documents that need to be rendered
This list will be rendered at "https://specs.amwa.tv/<spec>/<version>/docs/"

- Use a "-" bullet character for each document, indented as you want it to appear in the list, followed by a space
- Follow that with the name to display, in square brackets
- Follow that immediately by then the document filename, in round parentheses
  - Include the ".md"
  - Don't include the "docs/"
  - Escape any spaces with "%20" (this is needed so links work on github.com)
- Don't use document numbers (this was previous practice for NMOS docs)
- Other text and headings can be included.  Level-3 headings ("###") work best.
- The display name and filename don't need to match (see IS-04 for examples of this).
- All documents that need rendering must be listed.

See https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-template/docs/README.md for an example of the syntax
