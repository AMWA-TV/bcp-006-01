# Style Guide

The [APIs](../APIs/) and [schemas](../APIs/schemas/) are the foundation of the Specifications.

Use these documents to clarify the APIs and schemas, and make any further normative specification that is needed.

Be careful with normative and non-normative language.

It may be better to put lengthy guidance in a separate implementation guide.

Markdown will be linted, so try to keep consistent with what is in this template and what is in other specs.  See <https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-lint-scripts> for details.
